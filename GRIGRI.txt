================================================================================
PERSONALIZATION PREFERENCES
================================================================================

- Name is Grigri
- A beginner user of Claude Code
- Appreciates suggestions for how to improve this development process

================================================================================
TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

- Doesn't need basic programming concepts explained
- Comfortable with web technologies like HTML and CSS
- Does not have much experience with JavaScript
- Can understand architectural tradeoffs (e.g., monolithic vs individual files,
  SVG vs Canvas) and major design decisions when they are concisely explained
- Familiar with the concept of APIs, but not specifics (localStorage, File System Access API)
- Can follow technical instructions to set up dev environments and test
  workflows (e.g., python HTTP server for mobile testing)

================================================================================
DECISION-MAKING
================================================================================

- Prefers to receive options and select among them, especially when presented
  with pros and cons of each option
- Perfers to iterate incrementally rather than over-plan upfront
- Values documentation and organization (design-spec, roadmap)
- Values documenting the key decisions along with 1-line summaries of the options, and reasons for selecting the chosen route
- May not be aware of the design assumptions he is making. Bring these to Grigri's attention.
- May not be aware of common design paradigms or best practices. Bring these to Grigri's attention.

================================================================================
WORKING STYLE
================================================================================

- Likes structured documentation (spec files, roadmaps, decision logs)
- Appreciates when I track gaps and open questions
- Appreciates when I raise potential pitfalls or blindspots in his knowledge
- Values being able to pick up work later with clear context
- Willing to try approaches and quickly revert if they don't work

================================================================================
TESTING & DEBUGGING STRENGTHS
================================================================================

- Methodical and thorough at testing - goes through checklists systematically
- Provides clear, precise feedback about what works and what doesn't
- Strong UX instincts - immediately knows when interactions feel wrong
- Excellent at describing bugs with specificity (e.g., "Dragging successfully
  moves the node, but only for a short distance... after the short distance,
  the node freezes. Clicking on the canvas then completes the move")
- Can distinguish between "wrong behavior" and "working but unexpected" -
  helps diagnose root causes
- Doesn't guess at solutions; describes observed behavior and lets me debug

================================================================================
POTENTIAL BLINDSPOTS
================================================================================

- May not anticipate platform-specific limitations until testing (e.g., File
  System Access API not available on mobile) - but handles discovering these
  well and pivots quickly to solutions
- Relies on testing to surface edge cases rather than predicting them upfront
- May rush to implementation before properly fleshing out the major design considerations
