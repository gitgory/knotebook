GRAPH NOTES - DESIGN SPECIFICATION
================================================================================
Created: 2026-01-21
Updated: 2026-01-25
Status: Phase 8 (Tier 1/2 features in progress)

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

A browser-based note-taking application where notes form a cyclic graph
structure. Notes are nodes, relationships are edges. Notes can contain
nested sub-graphs of other notes, creating a hierarchical/fractal structure.

================================================================================
KEY DECISIONS
================================================================================

1. VISUALIZATION
   - Visual graph canvas interface using SVG
   - Notes displayed as rounded rectangles (220x60 px)
   - Relationships displayed as lines (1px thickness)
   - Point-and-click interaction for manipulating nodes and edges
   - Drag-and-drop repositioning of nodes
   - Infinite canvas with pan (drag empty space) and zoom (scroll wheel)

2. NOTE CONTENT
   - Title field (displayed on node)
   - Basic text content (no rich formatting)
   - User-generated hashtags (e.g., #idea, #project), sorted alphabetically
   - Completion status (opt-in): null | 'no' | 'yes' | 'partial'

3. EDGES
   - Simple, undirected connections
   - No relationship types or labels
   - No directionality (A-B is same as B-A)

4. DATA STORAGE
   - Projects stored in browser localStorage (works on mobile)
   - Auto-save: debounced, 1-2 seconds after last change
   - File export uses monolithic JSON format for portability
   - Each note contains:
     * ID, title, content
     * Hashtags
     * Canvas position (x, y)
     * Child notes and child edges (for nesting)
     * Creation/modification timestamps

5. NESTING STRUCTURE
   - Notes can contain their own sub-graph (canvas within a canvas)
   - Nesting is unlimited in depth
   - Edges only connect sibling notes (same parent)
   - No cross-branch connections ("cousins" cannot connect)
   - Visual indicator: stacked rectangles behind node (click to enter)
     * 1 offset rect for 1-2 children, 2 offset rects for 3+ children
   - Deletion behavior:
     * Deleting a node promotes its children to the current level
     * Child positions are adjusted to appear near the deleted parent
     * Edges between promoted children are preserved
     * Edges connected to the deleted node are removed

6. USER INTERFACE
   - Landing page with New Project / Load Project options
   - Compact toolbar with icon buttons:
     * ⌂ Home (return to landing page)
     * + Add Note (appears at center of viewport with slight random offset)
     * ⬇ Export to file
     * ⛶ Fit to View
     * ◐ Theme selector (dropdown)
     * ? Keyboard shortcuts help
     * [search field] Search notes by title/content
     * # Hashtag sidebar toggle
     * [search field] Filter by hashtag(s)
   - Breadcrumb navigation for nested notes
   - Node visual indicators:
     * Dog-ear fold (top-left): note has body text beyond hashtags
     * Completion icon (top-right): clickable status (To do / Done / Partial)
     * Stacked rectangles (behind node): note has children (clickable to enter)

7. THEMING
   - 5 dark color themes: Midnight, Obsidian, Forest, Ember, Slate
   - Theme selection persists in localStorage
   - CSS custom properties for easy theming

8. HASHTAG SEARCH/FILTER
   - Toolbar input field, always visible
   - Type one or more hashtags (e.g., #idea #project)
   - OR logic: shows notes matching ANY entered hashtag
   - Non-matching nodes and their edges are hidden
   - Searches current navigation level only
   - Clear filter: X button in field or clear text
   - Clicking hashtag in editor populates search field
   - Keyboard shortcut: / to focus search field
   - Visual feedback: accent border on input when filter active

9. HASHTAG SIDEBAR
   - Right-side panel, toggled via # button or H key
   - Shows all hashtags at current level with counts
   - Click hashtag to filter by it
   - Color picker for each hashtag (12-color preset palette)
   - Hashtags displayed as colored pills
   - Colors saved per-project in JSON file

10. PROJECT STORAGE (localStorage + File Export)
    - Projects stored in browser localStorage (works on mobile)
    - Auto-save: debounced, 1-2 seconds after last change
    - Landing page shows project list:
      * Each project shows name and note count
      * ⋮ menu button for actions (rename, delete, export)
      * "New Project" button prompts for name
      * "Import" button to load from file
    - Import behavior: prompt to create new project or overwrite existing
    - Delete always requires confirmation
    - Toolbar ⬇ button repurposed as "Export to file"
    - File export uses existing JSON format for portability

11. TEXT SEARCH FILTER
    - Toolbar "Search..." input, always visible alongside hashtag filter
    - Matches against note title and content (case-insensitive)
    - AND logic with hashtag filter (both must match if both active)
    - Current level only (same scope as hashtag filter)
    - Keyboard shortcut: S to focus search field
    - Visual feedback: highlight border when filter active
    - Clears on navigation, project switch, and going home

12. COMPLETION STATUS
    - Optional per-note status field for task management
    - States: null (not set) → 'no' (To do) → 'yes' (Done) → 'partial' (Partial)
    - Editor: row of status buttons (None / To do / Done / Partial)
    - Node display: clickable icon in top-right area
      * 'no': empty gray circle
      * 'yes': green checkmark
      * 'partial': orange half-circle
    - Click indicator on node to cycle states (mouse and touch)
    - Not set by default — opt-in via editor

13. SECURITY
    - XSS PROTECTION (CRITICAL)
      * NEVER use innerHTML with user-generated content
      * ALWAYS use textContent for user data (titles, content, hashtags, names)
      * Build DOM elements programmatically with createElement/createElementNS
      * Data attributes set via .dataset are automatically escaped
      * This applies to: project names, note titles, hashtags, note content

      Pattern:
      ✅ GOOD: element.textContent = userInput
      ✅ GOOD: element.dataset.tag = userHashtag
      ❌ BAD:  element.innerHTML = `<div>${userInput}</div>`

    - INPUT VALIDATION
      * Sanitize on output, not input (preserve original user data)
      * Trust browser's automatic escaping in textContent and setAttribute
      * No manual HTML escaping needed when using safe DOM APIs

REMAINING QUESTIONS
================================================================================

   - Export to other formats (Markdown, plain text)?
   - Import from other note apps?
   - Force-directed graph layout option?
   - Search across all notes and nested content?
   - Drag nodes into another to make them children?
