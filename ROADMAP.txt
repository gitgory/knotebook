See SESSION_NOTES.md for more recent changes.

================================================================================
RECENTLY COMPLETED (2026-01-27)
================================================================================

[x] Per-notebook settings with default completion mode (2026-01-27)
    - Settings modal accessible from toolbar gear icon and notebook context menu
    - "New notes are tasks by default" toggle (Off = None, On = To do)
    - Settings persisted in localStorage and JSON export/import
    - Old imports without settings key default to non-task mode

[x] Auto-save editor with Cancel button (2026-01-27)
    - Editor now saves on every close action (ESC, Enter, click outside, hashtag click, step-into)
    - Cancel button (red) reverts all changes to pre-open state
    - Shift+Enter inserts newline in body; plain Enter saves and closes
    - Text selection drag out of editor no longer accidentally closes it
    - Empty nodes still auto-deleted on both save and cancel

[x] Completed notes visual styling (2026-01-27)
    - Notes marked "Done" render with grayscale + 50% brightness
    - Uses CSS filter (grayscale(1) brightness(0.5)) to keep nodes opaque
    - Node stays fully interactive (clickable, draggable, selectable)

[x] Terminology update (2026-01-27)
    - "Project" → "Notebook" in all user-facing text
    - "Hashtag" → "Tag" in all user-facing text
    - Code identifiers unchanged (variable names, CSS classes, HTML IDs)

[x] Text search filter (#1)
    - Toolbar "Search..." input filters nodes by title and content
    - Case-insensitive, AND logic with hashtag filter
    - S keyboard shortcut to focus, Escape to clear
    - Clears on navigation, project switch, and going home

[x] Hashtag alphabetical sort (#2)
    - parseHashtags() now sorts output alphabetically (case-insensitive)
    - Consistent across node pills, editor display, and filter parsing
    - Sidebar was already sorted independently

[x] Body text indicator (#3) — needs mobile testing
    - Dog-ear fold in top-left corner of node when content has text beyond hashtags
    - SVG path (18×18px) that follows the node's rounded corner
    - Accent color at 40% opacity

[x] Completion checkbox (#5) — needs mobile testing
    - Tri-state: To do (○) → Done (✓ green) → Partial (◐ orange) → To do
    - Opt-in via editor status buttons (None / To do / Done / Partial)
    - SVG icons (16px) in top-right area, hit target r=12
    - Clickable on node to cycle states (mouse and touch)
    - completion field added to node data model (null when not set)

[x] Children indicator redesign (part of #3/#5 work)
    - Replaced [n] text indicator with stacked rectangles behind the node
    - 1 offset rect for 1-2 children, 2 offset rects for 3+ children
    - Click stacked area to enter node (same behavior as old [n])

DECISIONS LOG
================================================================================

2026-01-27: Per-notebook settings
    - Settings stored as `settings` object in project data (alongside nodes, edges, hashtagColors)
    - First setting: `defaultCompletion` (null or 'no')
    - Accessible from both toolbar (in-memory) and context menu (direct localStorage read/write)
    - Completion control always visible in editor regardless of mode; only the default changes
    - Backwards compatible: missing settings key defaults to { defaultCompletion: null }

2026-01-27: Auto-save editor behavior
    - Default close action: save (was cancel)
    - Rationale: notes are saved more often than discarded; reduces friction
    - Cancel = explicit revert via snapshot, not just "close without saving"
    - Enter in textarea saves (Shift+Enter for newline) — matches chat-app patterns
    - Click-outside uses mousedown+click guard to prevent accidental close during text selection drag

2026-01-21: File storage → Monolithic JSON
    - Considered individual files per note
    - Chose monolithic for simplicity, atomic saves, and easy sharing

2026-01-22: Hashtag search/filter design
    - UI: Toolbar input (always visible) vs floating panel vs click-only
    - Chose toolbar input for discoverability and multi-hashtag support
    - Behavior: Hide non-matches vs dim vs highlight-only
    - Chose hide for cleaner focus on relevant notes
    - Scope: Current level only vs descendants vs entire project
    - Chose current level for simplicity, can expand later
    - Logic: OR (any match) vs AND (all must match)
    - Chose OR for broader, more intuitive filtering

2026-01-22: Project storage redesign
    - Problem: File System Access API doesn't work on mobile
    - Solution: localStorage as primary storage, file export for portability
    - Auto-save: Debounced (1-2 sec) vs immediate vs periodic
    - Chose debounced for balance of responsiveness and performance
    - Project naming: Prompt on creation vs auto-name
    - Chose prompt for intentional naming
    - Import: Create new vs prompt for action
    - Chose prompt to give user control over overwrites

2026-01-23: Deletion behavior for nodes with children
    - Cascade delete vs block deletion vs promote children
    - Chose promote: children move to current level, preserving content
    - Edges between promoted children preserved, edges to deleted node removed

2026-01-25: Text search filter design (#1)
    - Separate input vs combined with hashtag filter
    - Chose separate: clearer purpose, both visible simultaneously
    - Filter logic: AND between text search and hashtag filter
    - Scope: same as hashtag filter (current level only)
    - Matching: case-insensitive against node.title and node.content

2026-01-25: Body text indicator design (#3)
    - Options considered:
      (a) Small dot in top-right corner → overlapped with completion indicator
      (b) Small dot in bottom-left corner → hidden behind hashtag pills
      (c) Hamburger menu icon (≡) after title text → looks like a clickable button
      (d) Dog-ear triangle in top-left corner ← CHOSEN
    - Chose dog-ear: universal "document has content" metaphor, subtle,
      fits in unused corner, no overlap with other indicators

2026-01-25: Completion checkbox design (#5)
    - State cycle: null (not set) → no → yes → partial → no
    - Activation: opt-in via editor (not always visible on every node)
    - Node display: SVG icons in top-right area
      * 'no': empty gray circle (○)
      * 'yes': green checkmark (✓)
      * 'partial': orange half-circle (◐)
    - Interaction: click indicator on node to cycle, or set via editor buttons

2026-01-25: Children indicator redesign (stacked rectangles)
    - Options considered:
      (a) Keep [n] text indicator — functional but text-heavy
      (b) Different node shape (stacked rectangles) ← CHOSEN
    - Chose stacked rects: more visually intuitive ("there's stuff underneath"),
      common UI pattern (file vs folder), frees up bottom-right space,
      looks cleaner than text-based indicator
    - Depth: 1 offset rect (1-2 children), 2 offset rects (3+ children)
    - Offset rects are clickable to enter the node
